# crudeNbody

This is the project I did in summer 2017. A very crude 3D N-body collision-less simulations that generated by gravitational forces in python.

NOTE: the external force exterted on one partilce is calculated twice since the force between two particles is mutual
and I had not done optimaztion for this.
